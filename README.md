# aurora-bank-calc
Calculates the per-round bank balance of any wealth-job-species combination of your choice, so you don't have to do the math yourself.

## How to run

### Python Version
If you have Python 3 installed on your computer, you can directly run the Python file with no extra effort.

### Executable Version
If you do **not** have Python 3 installed on your computer, you can instead run the `bankcalc.exe` file provided in the zip folder download. This includes all the necessary files to run the calculator.

Notes:

- This repo uses `py2exe` to allow python files to run as a standard program on Windows machines for its x86 releases. Editing the files that are built with this tool will likely cause something to horribly break.
